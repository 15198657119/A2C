# GP

Our GP focuses on Model-Based Reinforcement Learning.

We're focusing on the implementation of the I2A (Imagination-augmented agents) with A2C (Advantage actor-critic GPU) as a baseline and RES (Recurrent Environment Simulator) as the environment model.

You can install it by typing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mrgemy95/GP
cd GP
pip install -e .
```
